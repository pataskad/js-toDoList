-  This app is designed to be a more complex demonstration of combining the powers of webpack and npm with a more thought out front end interface through the popular 'to do list' projects seen throughout the industry.  Besides the utilization of workflow management tools like webpack and npm, this project also focuses on using industry best practices for organizing and maintaining the code base.  This will include following SOLID principles, using factory functions or classes.  Additionally, separate modules will be initialized to segment and cohere with the SOLID principles for improved maintainability, readability, and allow for maximum performance to the end user.
